Hello world!

This text is using markdown to define how it should be styled. It means you can write a h1 heading like this:

# I'm the main title

and a smaller h2 heading like this:

## I'm slightly lower in the hierarchy but still pretty important!

Separating text by a new line automatically creates paragraphs.

Mind that you also need new lines around elements like headings, images, lists, etc

Text can be **bold** or _italic_.

You can create links like this one to the [SNG website](http://www.sng.sk/sk).
